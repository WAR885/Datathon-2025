"#This Dashboard both details the monthly profits as well as the most popular items and ingredients from month to month. It also aims to predict the following months income as well as most popular items based on the average from prior data.

The script processes and uses all of the monthly data as well as the ingredient amounts per item

To run, run the file named dashboard.py which should pop up a tkinter window

From this dashboard, one can see which months had higher income and how income changed from month to month.
One can also see the most in demand items/ingredients and pivot towards advertising/selling these items more.

Lastly, next month's prediction can help create a profit forecast as well as understanding which items are in demand, thus understanding how many of these items to make.

NOTE: There is a bug where the widget for the monthly data is squished. It only sometimes does this and I was not able to figure this bug out. If this happens, run the program again and it shouldn't be squished"
